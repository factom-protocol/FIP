# Summary

Unifiying and simplifying the way the config file (`factomd.conf`) and the command line parameters are loaded. Settings are arranged by common functionality with the ability to overwrite any setting on a network-by-network basis. All settings available in the config are also command line parameters, with the command line parameter superceding the configuration setting. Command line parameters are named the same as config file options, with short names for select, high use settings.

The old config file will be deprecated but still readable to not break existing nodes.

# Motivation

At the moment, it's very inconvenient to add new flags to the node since parsing is spread out over several files and it's not clear where or which settings are overwritten in what way. The config file is defined in `util/config.go` and parsed by `state/state.go` during `engine/NetStart.go`, which will initialize the state. Parameters are parsed by `engine/factomParams.go` in `main()` and then overwritten throughout `NetStart`. Adding a config setting with flag requires editing three different packages and four files. Some settings are config only, some settings are command line only.

If you are running multiple nodes on the same machine, such as for development work, it's also not possible to use the same configuration for every use-case (main vs testnet) and files have to be swapped. Being able to set network-specific settings would enable one config file for multiple networks. 


# Specification

The config file and command line parameters will be evaluated before the factomd node is run

1. Parse the command line flags and check for valid names, stop execution if there are invalid names or values
2. Create a configuration object with default values
3. Check if the "config" parameter is present, otherwise use default path, and parse the file
4. Overwrite the default configuration with values from the config
5. Determine the network from the config file and command line flag
6. Overwrite the config default values with custom values from the network's group
7. Overwrite settings with the ones specified by the command line flags
8. The configuration is passed to the Factomd() call that loads the node

The configuration file consists of the following sections and settings, which are all case insensitive except for the names of the networks:
```
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Configurations for factomd
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; All settings are case insensitive and you can override specific settings in
; the factomd section with network-by-network settings by adding a 
; [factomd.NETWORKNAME] category, e.g.: [factomd.MAIN] or [factomd.fct_community_test]
; These settings will only take effect for that network
;
; All settings are case-insensitive with a command line equivalent of "--name=value",
; e.g.: "--blocktime=10m"
;
; Time-based variables allow semantic input between seconds (s)
; minutes (m), hours (h), days (d), defaulting to seconds:
;   180 = 180s = 3m
;   48h = 2d
;

# Changes

Some of these settings appear new but they are an amalgamation of previous settings to reduce confusion.

| New | Old Config | Old Cmd | Description |
|-----|------------|---------|-------------|
|network|network<br>N/A|network<br>customnet|These settings have been rolled into one, meaning you can specify network=MAIN or network=fct_community_test. The drawback is that it's no longer possible to have a custom network named "MAIN" which is separate from the actual "MAIN" network. <br><br>Further, input has been limited to A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _ to prevent confusing names (such as utf8 lookalikes). This change is up for debate|
|homeDir|HomeDir|factomhome|  |
|blockTime|DirectoryBlockInSeconds|blktime| Dropping 'InSeconds' due to new time system | 
|faultTimeout|N/A|faulttimeout| |
|roundTimeout|N/A|roundtimeout||
|forceFollower|NodeMode|N/A|The previous settings were "FULL" and "SERVER" which are not self explanatory. Using "FULL" simply forced a node to run as follower while "SERVER" auto-determined. This change reflects that behavior|
|oracleChain|ExchangeRateChainId|N/A|Shortening and calling it "oracle". "Exchange rate" was ambiguous as it does not specify if it's FCT to USD, FCT to Factoshi, or * to EC.|
|oraclePublicKey|ExchangeRateAuthority<br>PublicKey<br>ExchangeRateAuthority<br>PublicKeyMainNet<br>ExchangeRateAuthority<br>PublicKeyTestNet<br>ExchangeRateAuthority<br>PublicKeyLocalNet|N/A|Unifying these into one setting using the new network-specific categories|
|bootstrapIdentity<br>boostrapKey|CustomBootstrapIdentity<br>CustomBootstrapKey|N/A|Dropping "custom"|
|noBalanceHash|N/A|balancehash|Changing name to reflect the default of false|
|startDelay|N/A|startdelay||
|identityChain|IdentityChainID|N/A|dropping "id"|
|identityPrivateKey<br>identityPublicKey|LocalServerPrivKey<br>LocalServerPublicKey|N/A|Grouping as identity|
|identityActivationHeight|ChangeAcksHeight|N/A|Renaming to be more descriptive of what it does (the brainswap variable)|
|apiPort|port|port|Ambiguity change|
|controlPanel|ControlPanelSetting|controlpanelsetting|Removing redundancy|
|controlPanelPort|ControlPanelPort|controlpanelport||
|controlPanelName|N/A|nodename|The name is a display name only used in the control panel|
|pprofExpose|N/A|exposeprofiler|Ambiguity / grouping|
|pprofPort|N/A|logPort|Ambiguity/grouping|
|pprofMPR|N/A|mpr|Grouping|
|webTLS|FactomdTlsEnabled|tls|grouping under "web services"|
|webTLSCertificate|FactomdTlsPublicCert|N/A||
|webTLSKey|FactomdTlsPrivateKey|N/A||
|webTLSCertificateHosts|N/A|selfaddr|Accepts a hybrid of hostnames and addresses, so I believe "Hosts" is more descriptive|
|webUsername<br>webPassword|FactomdRpcUser<br>FactomdRpcPass|rpcuser<br>rpcpass|Grouping|
|webCORS|CorsDomains|N/A|Grouping|
|dbType|DBType|db||
|dbSlug|N/A|prefix|Named after [url slugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug) but the name is up for debate|
|dbLdbPath|LdbPath|N/A|Grouping|
|dbBoltPath|BoltDBPath|N/A|Grouping + Unifying|
|dbExportData|ExportData|N/A|Grouping|
|dbExportDataPath|ExportDataSubPath|N/A|Grouping + Shortening|
|dbNoFastBoot|FastBoot|fast|Changing name to reflect default of false|
|dbFastBootRate|FastBootSaveRate|fastsaverate||
|p2pDisable|N/A|enablenet|Grouping|
|p2pPeerFileSuffix|PeersFile|N/A|Changing name to more accurately descript what it does. The file is pre-pended by the network name|
|p2pPort|MainNetworkPort<br>TestNetworkPort<br>LocalNetworkPort<br>CustomNetworkPort|networkport|Rolling into one setting with new group system|
|p2pSeed|MainSeedURL<br>TestSeedURL<br>LocalSeedURL<br>CustomSeedURL|N/A|Rolling into one setting with new group system|
|p2pFanout|N/A|broadcastnum||
|p2pSpecialPeers|MainSpecialPeers<br>TestSpecialPeers<br>LocalSpecialPeers<br>CustomSpecialPeers|peers|Rolling into one setting with new group system|
|p2pConnectionPolicy|N/A|exclusive<br>exclusive_in|"exclusive_in" was a more powerful setting of "exclusive", so those two booleans have been rolled into three connection policies: NORMAL,ACCEPT,REFUSE|
|p2pTimeout|N/A|deadline|Name is up for debate but I believe "timeout" gives people a better understanding even though "deadline" is more technically accurate|
|logLevel|logLevel|loglvl||
|logPath|LogPath|N/A||
|logJSON|N/A|logjson||
|logLogstash|N/A|logstash<br>logurl|This was a tandem setting that has been rolled into one. If there's a URL present, it's also enabled|
|logStdOut|N/A|stdoutlog|Grouping|
|logStdErr|N/A|stderrlog|Grouping|
|logMessages|N/A|debuglog|More descriptive name|
|logDBStates|N/A|wrproc|wrproc was short for "write processed db states"|
|simNoInput|N/A|sim_stdin|Grouping + Name change to reflect default of false|
|simCount|N/A|cnt|Grouping|
|simFocus|N/A|node|Grouping + more descriptive name|
|simNet|N/A|net|Grouping|
|simNetFile|N/A|fnet|Grouping|
|simDropRate|N/A|drop|Grouping + more descriptive name|
|simTimeOffset|N/A|timedelta|Grouping. Name change up for debate|
|simRuntimeLog|N/A|runtimelog|Grouping|
|simWait|N/A|waitentries|Grouping|
|debugConsole<br>debugConsolePort|N/A|debugconsole|This has been split up into two settings. Previously it was `(localhost|remote):<port>`. `localhost\|remote` or empty setting is now `debugConsole` of OFF, LOCAL, ON, with the port specified separately.|
|chainHeadFix|N/A|checkheads<br>fixheads|Two booleans with only 3 valid settings rolled into one with: OFF, IGNORE, ON|
|oneLeader|N/A|rotate|Match the name in the code|
|keepMismatch|N/A|keepmismatch||
|forceSync2Height|N/A|sync2|More descriptive|
|journalFile<br>journalMode<br>journalType|N/A|journaling<br>journal<br>follower<br>leader|Before, "journaling" turned it on and off, "journal" specified a file. If the file did not exist it was writing, if the file existed it was reading. There were also two booleans for forcing followers and leader, where (true, true) is invalid.|
|pluginPath|N/A|plugin|More descriptive|
|pluginTorrent<br>pluginTorrentUpload|N/A|tormanage<br>torupload||

### Deprecated Settings

|Config | Command Line | Reason |
|-------|--------------|--------|
|FastBootLocation||This still works but there's some inconsistency with regards to simulated nodes, which overwrite this setting. There's no reason to save this anywhere other than homedir, which is the default, but if this setting is still desired I'm open to un-deprecating it |
|ControlPanelFilesPath||Does nothing|
|ConsoleLogLevel||Does nothing|
|ExchangeRate||This setting exists but the value from the origin block is used instead|
||clonedb|Exists but has no effect on anything|




# Implementation

The configuration code is placed in its own "config" package under `factomd/config`. To parse the config file, the `go-ini` package is used to improve malleability and improved group support. In my research, I have not found a flag package that suits this scenario, as all packages include their own (redundant) error checking and data structures, which would result in requiring definitions to be in multiple places. Thus the flag parser will be a very simple parse-only algorithm that uses a combined error checking.

The configuration itself is only specified in one location: the `config/configuration.go` file, which contains the struct that the config is parsed into. The default values and types are specified via golang tags to reduce the number of places a developer has to add new settings.

Backward compatibility is determined by the presences of the old `[app]` category.

Development will happen in this branch: https://github.com/WhoSoup/factomd/tree/FACTOMIZE_config
